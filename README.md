# countupp-ios

Simple app for counting down to given date or count events. Lets call it a _simple habbits tracker_.

Main aim of this project was validation of SwiftUI production readiness. As it turned out, SwiftUI is increadibly inmature and undocumented framework. Additionaly, it has very poor performance during development (Xcode is unable to code compliation, completion, to provide parameter info or quick info) and in runtime (i.e. flickering during large/inline navbar).

**Despite the fact, this project was ridiculously simple, creating it with SwiftUI was not.**
